# Snowflakes

Create snowflakes in different languages using the raylib library (and wrappers).

## Requirements

- Raylib must be installed for the C case.
- Golang installation is handled with the Makefile (init and mod commands from golang).
- Python also requires the raylib wrapper installed (python3 -m pip install raylib).

Executables for C and Golang examples can be created using the Makefile by running make
in the terminal. For the python case, just cd into the directory and run: python recursion.py
